# Summary

My tool to reserach and demonstrate for class was SVG Background. The background providing website for the svg's is [BGJar.com](https://bgjar.com/).

The website provides different patterns that can be customized with any hexcolor. These backgrounds can be easy used for websites.

This react project demonstrates five of these backgrounds with their default styling.
