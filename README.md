# Summary

My tool to reserach and demonstrate was SVG Background. The background providing website for the svg's is [BGJar.com](https://bgjar.com/).

The website provides different patterns that can be customized to with any hexcolor. These backgrounds can be easy used as background for websites.

This react project demonstrates five of these backgrounds with their default styling.
